This project demonstrates concepts of front-end web development, game logic implementation, event handling, and basic artificial intelligence (AI).

Game Rules

1.The game is played on an N × N grid (minimum 3×3, maximum 10×10).

2.On each turn, a player places either ‘S’ or ‘O’ in an empty cell.

3.A player scores a point when the pattern S–O–S is formed in:

*Horizontal direction

*Vertical direction

*Diagonal direction

4.If a player forms one or more SOS patterns in a move:

*The SOS cells are highlighted

*The player gets extra points

*The same player gets another turn

5.Highlighted cells can still be reused to form new overlapping SOS patterns.

6.The game ends when all cells are filled.

7.The player with the highest score is declared the winner.
